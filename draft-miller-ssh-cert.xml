	<t>
	Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote
	connections and login over untrusted networks.
	SSH uses public key signatures for host authentication and
	commonly uses them for user authentication.
	This document describes a lightweight certificate format for use in
	these contexts.

	<t>
	All values in a certificate are encoded using the SSH wire
	representations specified by <xref target="RFC4251" />.

	<section anchor="fmt"><name>Public certificate format</name>
		<section><name>General structure and common fields</name>
			<t>
			Certificates have the following general structure:
			</t>
			<sourcecode>
    string              key type
    string              nonce
    byte[]              public key fields
    uint64              serial number
    uint32              certificate role
    string              identifier
    string              principals
    uint64              valid after
    uint64              valid before
    string              critical options
    string              extensions
    string              reserved
    string              signature key
    string              signature
			</sourcecode>
			<t>
			The "key type" string identifies the certificate type,
			e.g. "ssh-ed25519-cert" identifies an ED25519
			certificate. The valid certificate types are listed
			below.
			</t>
			<t>
			The "nonce" field contains a random nonce. This value
			MUST be at least 16 bytes in length. 32 bytes is
			typical.
			</t>
			<t>
			The "public key fields" section contains the actual
			public key material. These are specified below for
			each certificate type.
			</t>
			<t>
			The "certificate role" field indicates the role of the
			certificate, either SSH2_CERT_TYPE_USER for user
			authentication certificates or SSH2_CERT_TYPE_HOST
			authentication certificates.
			</t>
			<t>
			The "identifier" field contains a UTF-8 encoded,
			human-readable identifier for the certificate,
			suitable for display to the user, recording in logs,
			etc.
			</t>
			<t>
			The "principals" field contains one or more UTF-8
			encoded names, separated by commas. These
			names identify the principals the certificate is
			intended to authenticate. In the case of user
			certificates, these will typically be user names,
			whereas for host certificates they will be host names
			and/or numerical addresses.
			</t>
			<t>
			The "valid after" and "valid before" field represent
			a validity interval for the certificate with each
			field being interpreted as a number of seconds since
			the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970) except
			for two special values. A zero value in the
			"valid after" field indicates that the certificate
			is valid from any time to the "valid after" date.
			A all-1s (i.e. 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) value in the
			"valid after" field indicates that the certificate has
			no end expiry date.
			</t>
			<t>
			The "critical options" field contains zero or more
			of the certificate options described in
			<xref target="critopts" /> and encoded as described in
			<xref target="optionenc" />. If an implementation
			does not recognise or support a particular option
			contained in a certificate, then it MUST refuse to
			accept the certificate for authentication.
			</t>
			<t>
			The "extensions" field similarly contains zero or more
			of the certificate extensions described in
			<xref target="exts" /> and encoded as described in
			<xref target="optionenc" />.
			An implementation that does not recognise or support
			an extension present in a certificate extension section
			MUST ignore the extension.
			</t>
			<t>
			The "reserved" field is reserved for future use.
			Implementations MUST ignore the contents of this field
			if it is not empty.
			</t>
			<t>
			The "signature key" field contains the CA key used to
			sign the certificate, encoded as a SSH public key blob.
			Implementations MUST NOT accept certificate keys
			as CA keys.
			</t>
			<t>
			The "signature" field contains a signature, made using
			the CA signature key over the entire certificate
			excluding the "signature" field itself (i.e. everything
			from the "key type" up to and including the
			"signature key").
			The signature is encoded using the standard SSH
			signature encoding for the CA key type in question,
			e.g. <xref target="RFC5656" section="3.1.2"/>
			for ECDSA CA keys.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="dsacert"><name>DSA certificates</name>
			<t>
			DSA certificates have key type "ssh-dss-cert" and
			certify DSA keys as
			defined in <xref target="RFC4253" section="6.6" />.
			This format is equivalent to the vendor extension
			"ssh-dss-cert-v01@openssh.com".
			</t>

	<section anchor="optionenc"><name>Option / extension encoding</name>
		<t>
		The "critical options" and "extensions" certificate sections
		use the same format for encoding, though they differ in how
		unsupported options are handled.
		</t>
		<t>
		Both sections consist of zero or more key/value pairs, encoded
		as a pair of strings:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    string              key
    string              value
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		"key" should be a UTF-8 encoded string that identifies the
		option being encoded. Available keys for extensions and for
		critical options sections are listed below, but implementations
		may add their own options using the domain-qualified naming
		convention defined in <xref target="RFC4251" section="4.2" />.
		</t>
		<t>
		The contents and format of "value" are specific to each option
		or extension. Key/value pairs MUST be ordered lexically by key
		name.
		</t>
		<t>
		A common patten for flag-type options is for the
		value to be the empty string. For example, this is a complete
		extensions section that encodes a single flag value
		"permit-user-rc".
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
  00000016                           # Extensions section len=22
    0000000e                         # 1st key string len=14
      7065726d69742d757365722d7263   #   "permit-user-rc"
    00000000                         # 1st value string len=0
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		For options whose values encode textual values, it is common
		for the value to contain a nested string. For example, the
		following is a complete criticial options section that sets
		a string-values option "force-command" to the value "sftp".
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
  0000001d                           # Criticial options len=29
    0000000d                         # 1st key string len=13
      666f7263652d636f6d6d616e64     #   "force-command"
    00000008                         # 1st value string len=8

        73667470                     #     "sftp"
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		Finally, the following is an example of a critical options
		section that contains a flag option "foo@example.com" and
		a string-valued option "force-command" with a the value "sftp".
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
  00000038                           # Criticial options len=56

	<t>
	This section records the status of known implementations of the
	protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
	this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
	<xref target="RFC7942" />. The description of implementations in
	this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes
	in progressing drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any
	individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
	IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
	information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
	This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a
	catalog of available implementations or their features. Readers
	are advised to note that other implementations may exist.
	</t>
	<t>
	According to <xref target="RFC7942" />, "this will allow reviewers
	and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that
	have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of
	valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented
	protocols more mature. It is up to the individual working groups
	to use this information as they see fit".
	</t>
	<t>
	The following example projects maintain implementations of SSH
	certificates. All have implemented them in the vendor extension
	namespace, e.g. "ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com".
