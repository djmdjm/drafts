1.  Introduction

   Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic protocol for secure remote
   connections and login over untrusted networks.  The SSH transport
   layer [RFC4253] uses symmetric encryption to provide a confidential
   and integrity-protected channel over which application traffic is
   carried.  When initially designed, the SSH protocol negotiated
   ciphers and MACs separately and combines them using a specified
   encrypt-and-MAC construction.

   [RFC5647] introduced the first AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with
   Additional Data) in the form of AES-GCM (Galois Counter Mode).  This
   document specified two algorithms: AEAD_AES_128_GCM and
   AEAD_AES_256_GCM.

   Unfortunately, this document contained a problem in how these new
   modes were negotiated in key exchange: Section 5.1 of [RFC5647]
   required that these new algorithm identifiers be included in both the
   "encryption_algorithms" and "mac_algorithms" fields on the
   SSH_MSG_KEXINIT negotiation message (Section 7.1 of [RFC4253]), and
   that algorithm negotiation must fail if the endpoints do not agree on
   the same algorithm for both cipher and MAC.

   This aspect of the design is problematic, as it creates the situation
   where two endpoints could propose well-formed algorithm proposals
   that contain shared algorithms that should (per [RFC4253]) yield a
   successful negotiated set of parameters, but could potentially fail
   to if the endpoints contain the AEAD_AES_128/256_GCM algorithms in
   different preference positions.  As such, these modes were not safe
   to use in the presence of other cipher/MAC preferences.

Internet-Draft  Fixed AES-GCM modes for the SSH protocol      March 2025


   Most SSH implementations have since adopted a different approach to
   negotiating AEAD modes in the key exchange phase.  Instead of
   requiring the same algorithm name to appear in both the
   "encryption_algorithms" and "mac_algorithms" SSH_MSG_KEXINIT fields,
   the AEAD appears only in the "encryption_algorithms" field and, if
   negotiated as the preferred cipher, negotiation of "mac_algorithms"
   is skipped entirely.  This approach was used by
   [I-D.ietf-sshm-chacha20-poly1305] and by the OpenSSH AES-GCM modes
   that are being specified here.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Revised AES-GCM modes

   This document defines two new AEAD modes for the SSH transport
   protocol, "aes128-gcm" and "aes256-gcm".  These modes have an
   identical construction to the AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM
   (respecitvely) from [RFC5647] except for their negotiation.

   Specifically, these modes inherit all provisions of [RFC5647] except
   those relating to Key Exchange (Section 5.1 of [RFC5647].  Instead,
   the following algorithm negotiation rules apply:

   AEAD modes, such as "aes128-gcm" or "aes256-gcm", MUST be listed in
   the "encryption_algorithms" field of SSH_MSG_KEXINIT packets only.
   They MUST NOT appear in the "mac_algorithms" field.

   When an AEAD mode is selected as the highest preference of the
   "encryption_algorithms" by the endpoints, MAC negotiation MUST be
   skipped and the contents of the "mac_algorithms" field ignored.
   Specifically, failures of the endpoints to agree on a mutual
   selection from the "mac_algorithms" field MUST NOT cause connection
   failure.

   This supports the situation where a client and server agree on an
   AEAD (which provides all the properties that SSH requires of a MAC),
   but have disjoint sets of proposed MAC algorithms.

2.1.  aes128-gcm

   This algorithm is identical to AEAD_AES_128_GCM defined in
   Section 6.1 of [RFC5647] except for the algorithm negotiation changes
   mentioned above.

2.2.  aes256-gcm

   This algorithm is identical to AEAD_AES_256_GCM defined in
   Section 6.2 of [RFC5647] except for the algorithm negotiation changes
   mentioned above.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This protocol requires one existing registry to be modified.

3.1.  Additions to SSH Encryption Algorithm Names

   IANA is requested to insert the following entries into the table
   Encryption Algorithm Names [IANA-SSH-EXT] under Secure Shell (SSH)
   Protocol Parameters [RFC4250].

                     +================+=============+
                     | Algorithm name | Reference   |
                     +================+=============+
                     | aes128-gcm     | Section 2.1 |
                     +----------------+-------------+
                     | aes256-gcm     | Section 2.2 |
                     +----------------+-------------+

                                 Table 1

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5647] apply.

5.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their

   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   protocol:
