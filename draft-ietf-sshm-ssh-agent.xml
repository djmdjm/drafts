<section><name>Introduction</name>
	<t>
	Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote
	connections and login over untrusted networks.
	It supports multiple authentication mechanisms,
	including public key authentication. This document
	describes the protocol for interacting with an agent
	that holds private keys. Clients (and possibly
	servers) can invoke the agent via this protocol
	to perform operations using public and private keys
	held in the agent.
	</t>
	<t>
	Holding keys in an agent offers usability and security
	advantages to loading and unwrapping them at each use.
	Moreover, the agent implements a simple protocol and
	presents a smaller attack surface than a key loaded into
	a full SSH server or client.
	</t>
	<t>
	This agent protocol is already widely used and a de-facto
	standard, having been implemented by a number of popular
	SSH clients and servers for many years. The purpose of
	this document is to describe the protocol as it has been
	implemented.
	</t>
	      
	<section anchor="requirements"><name>Requirements Language</name>
		<t>
		The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
	        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
	        RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
	        interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/>
	        <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in
	        all capitals, as shown here.
		</t>
	</section>
</section>
    
<section><name>Protocol Overview</name>
	<t>
	The agent protocol is a packetised request-response protocol,
	solely driven by the client. It consists of a number of
	requests sent from the client to the server and a set of reply
	messages that are sent in response. At no time does the server
	send messages except in response to a client request. Replies
	are sent in order.
	</t>
	<t>
	Agents MAY implement support for only a subset of operations
	or available key types, and MAY additionally refuse arbitrary
	operations in particular contexts. For example, an agent may
	allow only local clients of an agent to add or remove keys, or
	make particular subsets of keys available to a given client.
	For this reason, clients of the agent SHOULD be prepared to
	fail gracefully if any operation is refused.
	</t>
	<t>
	Note that this protocol is separate to and incompatible with
	the one described in the similarly-named
	<xref target="draft-ietf-secsh-agent-02" /> which expired
	in 2004.
	</t>
</section>
    
<section><name>Protocol Messages</name>
	<t>
	All values in the agent protocol are encoded using the SSH wire
	representations specified by <xref target="RFC4251" />.
	Messages consist of a length, type and contents.
	</t>
	<sourcecode>
    uint32            length
    byte              type
    byte[length - 1]  contents
	</sourcecode>
	<t>
	In the sections below, the "length" field is omitted. For
	clarity, the symbolic names of the messages are shown;
	their numeric values are listed in <xref target="messagenum"/>
	below.
	</t>

	<section><name>Generic server responses</name>
		<t>
		The following generic messages may be sent by the server
		in response to requests from the client. On success the
		agent may reply either with:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte              SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		or a request-specific success message.
		On failure, the agent may reply with:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte              SSH_AGENT_FAILURE
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		or a request-specific success message.
		SSH_AGENT_FAILURE messages are also sent in reply to
		requests with unknown types.
		</t>
	</section>
	<section><name>Adding keys to the agent</name>
		<t>
		Keys may be added to the agent using the
		SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY or
		SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED messages.
		The latter variant allows adding keys with
		optional constraints on their usage.
		</t>
		<t>
		The generic format for the key
		SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY message is:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY
    string           key type
    byte[]           contents
    string           comment
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		Here "key type" is the specified key type name, for example
		"ssh-rsa" for a RSA key as defined by
		<xref target="RFC4253" />. "contents"
		consists of the public and private components of the key
		and vary by key type, they are listed below for
		standard and commonly used key types. "comment" is
		an optional human-readable key name or comment
		as a UTF-8 string that may serve to identify the
		key in user-visible messages.
		</t>
		<t>
		The SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED is similar, but adds a
		extra field:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED
    string           key type
    byte[]           contents
    string           comment
    constraint[]     constraints
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		Constraints are used to place limits on the validity
		or use of keys.
		<xref target="constraints" /> details constraint types
		and their format.
		</t>
		<t>
		An agent MUST reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS
		if the key was successfully loaded
		as a result of one of these messages, or
		SSH_AGENT_FAILURE otherwise.
		</t>
		<t>
		An agent MAY support only a subset of the key types defined
		here and may support additional key types as described below.
		If an agent does not recognise the type name in a request to
		add a key, then it MUST fail gracefully and respond with a
		SSH_AGENT_FAILURE reply.
		</t>
		<section><name>DSA keys</name>
			<t>
			DSA keys have key type "ssh-dss" and are
			defined in <xref target="RFC4253" />. They
			may be added to the agent using the following
			message. The "constraints" field is only
			present for the SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED
			message.
			</t>
			<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY or
                     SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED
    string           "ssh-dss"
    mpint            p
    mpint            q
    mpint            g
    mpint            y
    mpint            x
    string           comment
    constraint[]     constraints
			</sourcecode>
			<t>
			The "p", "q", "g" values are the DSA domain
			parameters. "y" and "x" are the public and
			private keys respectively. These values are
			as defined by Section 4.1 of
			<xref target="FIPS.186-4"/>.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section><name>ECDSA keys</name>
			<t>
			ECDSA keys have key types starting with
			"ecdsa-sha2-" and are defined in
			<xref target="RFC5656" />. They
			may be added to the agent using the
			following message.
			The "constraints" field is only present for
			the SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED message.
			</t>
			<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY or
                     SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED
    string           key type
    string           ecdsa_curve_name
    string           Q
    mpint            d
    string           comment
    constraint[]     constraints
			</sourcecode>
			<t>
			The values "Q" and "d" are the ECDSA public and
			private values respectively. Both are defined
			by Section 6.2 of <xref target="FIPS.186-5"/>.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section><name>EDDSA keys</name>
			<t>
			<xref target="RFC8709" /> defines Ed25519 and
			Ed448 with key type names "ssh-ed25519" and
			"ssh-ed448" respectively.
			These may be added to the agent using the
			following message. The "constraints"
			field is only present for
			the SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED message.
			</t>
			<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY or
                     SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED
    string           "ssh-ed25519" or "ssh-ed448"
    string           ENC(A)
    string           k || ENC(A)
    string           comment
    constraint[]     constraints
			</sourcecode>
			<t>
			The first value is the EDDSA public key
			ENC(A).
			The second value is a concatenation of
			the private key k
			and the public
			ENC(A) key.
			The contents and interpretation of the
			ENC(A)
			and k values are
			defined by <xref target="RFC8032" section="3.2"/>.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section><name>RSA keys</name>
			<t>
			RSA keys have key type "ssh-rsa" and are
			defined in <xref target="RFC4253" />. They
			may be added to the agent using the following
			message. The "constraints" field is only
			present for the
			SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED message.
			</t>
			<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY or
                     SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED
    string           "ssh-rsa"
    mpint            n
    mpint            e
    mpint            d
    mpint            iqmp
    mpint            p
    mpint            q
    string           comment
    constraint[]     constraints
			</sourcecode>
			<t>
			"n" is the public composite modulus.
			"p" and "q" are its constituent private
			prime factors. "e" is the public exponent.
			"iqmp" is the inverse of "q" modulo
			"p". All these values except "iqmp"
			(which can be calculated from the others)
			are defined by Section 5.1 of
			<xref target="FIPS.186-4" />.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section><name>Other keys</name>
			<t>
			Agents and their clients MAY support additional key
			types not documented here. Vendor-specific key types
			MUST use the domain-qualified naming convention
			defined in <xref target="RFC4251" section="4.2" />
			until code-points are allocated by IANA.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section><name>Adding keys from a token</name>
			<t>
			Keys hosted on smart-cards or other hardware
			tokens may be added using the
			SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY and
			SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY_CONSTRAINED
			requests. Note that "constraints" field is only
			included for the
			SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY_CONSTRAINED
			variant of this message.
			</t>
			<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY or
                     SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY_CONSTRAINED
    string           id
    string           PIN
    constraint[]     constraints
			</sourcecode>
			<t>
			Here "id" is an opaque identifier for the
			hardware token and "PIN" is an optional
			password or PIN to unlock the key.
			The interpretation of "id" is not defined
			by the protocol but is left solely up to
			the agent.
			</t>
			<t>
			Typically only the public components of
			any keys supported on a hardware token
			will be loaded into an agent so, strictly
			speaking, this message really arranges
			future private key operations to be
			delegated to the hardware token in question.
			</t>
			<t>
			An agent MUST reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS
			if one or more keys were successfully loaded
			as a result of one of these messages, or
			SSH_AGENT_FAILURE if no keys were found.
			The agent SHOULD also return SSH_AGENT_FAILURE
			if the token "id" was not recognised or if
			the agent doesn't support token-hosted keys
			at all.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Key Constraints" anchor="constraints">
			<t>
			A number of constraints and may be used in the
			constrained variants of the key add messages.
			Each constraint is represented by a type byte
			followed by zero or more value bytes.
			</t>
			<t>
			Zero or more constraints may be specified when
			adding a key with one of the *_CONSTRAINED
			requests. Multiple constraints are appended
			consecutively to the end of the request:
			</t>
			<sourcecode>
    byte             constraint1_type
    byte[]           constraint1_data
    byte             constraint2_type

    ....
    byte             constraintN_type
    byte[]           constraintN_data
			</sourcecode>
			<t>
			If an agent does not recognise or support a
			requested constraint it MUST refuse the request
			and return a SSH_AGENT_FAILURE message to the
			client.
			</t>
			<t>
			The following constraints are defined.
			</t>
			<section><name>Key lifetime constraint</name>
				<t>
				This constraint requests that the

				dialog before completing a signature
				operation.
				</t>
				<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENT_CONSTRAIN_CONFIRM

	<section anchor="pubkeyblob"><name>Public key encoding</name>
		<t>
		Keys previously loaded into an agent are referred to by their
		public key blob, which is the standard SSH wire encoding for
		public keys. SSH protocol key encodings are defined in
		<xref target="RFC4253" /> for "ssh-rsa" and "ssh-dss" keys,
		in <xref target="RFC5656" /> for "ecdsa-sha2-*" keys and in

		keys.
		</t>
	</section>
	<section><name>Removing keys from the agent</name>
		<t>
		A client may request that an agent remove
		all keys that it stores:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_REMOVE_ALL_IDENTITIES
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		On receipt of such a message, an agent
		shall delete all keys that it is holding
		and reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS.
		</t>
		<t>
		Specific keys may also be removed:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_REMOVE_IDENTITY
    string           key blob
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		Where "key blob" is the standard public key encoding of the
		key to be removed (<xref target="pubkeyblob" />).
		</t>
		<t>
		An agent shall reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS if the key was
		deleted or SSH_AGENT_FAILURE if it was not found.
		</t>
		<t>
		Smartcard keys may be removed using:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_REMOVE_SMARTCARD_KEY
    string           reader id
    string           PIN
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		Where "reader id" is an opaque identifier for the hardware token
		and "PIN" is an optional password or PIN (not typically
		used), both encoded using UTF-8.
		Requesting deletion of smartcard-hosted keys SHOULD
		cause the agent to remove all keys loaded from that smartcard.
		</t>
		<t>
		An agent shall reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS if the key was
		deleted or SSH_AGENT_FAILURE if it was not found.
		</t>
	</section>
	<section><name>Requesting a list of keys</name>

		A client may request a list of keys from an agent using the
		following message:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_REQUEST_IDENTITIES
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		The agent shall reply with a message with the following
		preamble.
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENT_IDENTITIES_ANSWER
    uint32           nkeys
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		Where "nkeys" indicates the number of keys to follow.
		Following the preamble are zero or more keys, each encoded as:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    string           key blob
    string           comment
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		Where "key blob" is the standard public key encoding of the
		key (<xref target="pubkeyblob" />) and "comment" is a
		human-readable comment encoded as a UTF-8 string.
		</t>
	</section>
	<section><name>Private key operations</name>
		<t>
		A client may request the agent perform a
		private key signature operation using the
		following message:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_SIGN_REQUEST
    string           key blob
    string           data
    uint32           flags
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		Where "key blob" is the key requested to perform the
		signature (encoded as per <xref target="pubkeyblob" />),
		"data" is the data to be signed and "flags" is a bitfield
		containing the bitwise OR of zero or more signature flags
		(see below).
		</t>
		<t>
		If the agent does not support the requested flags, or is
		otherwise unable or unwilling to generate the signature (e.g.
		because it doesn't have the specified key, or the user
		refused confirmation of a constrained key), it must reply
		with a SSH_AGENT_FAILURE message.
		</t>
		<t>
		On success, the agent shall reply with:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENT_SIGN_RESPONSE
    string           signature
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		The signature format is specific to the algorithm of the key
		type in use.  SSH protocol signature formats are defined in
		<xref target="RFC4253" /> for "ssh-rsa" and "ssh-dss" keys,
		in <xref target="RFC5656" /> for "ecdsa-sha2-*" keys and in
		<xref target="RFC8709" /> for "ssh-ed25519" and "ssh-ed448"
		keys.
		</t>
		<section><name>Signature flags</name>
			<t>
			Two flags are currently defined for
			signature request messages:
			SSH_AGENT_RSA_SHA2_256 and SSH_AGENT_RSA_SHA2_512.
			These two flags are only valid for
			"ssh-rsa" keys and request that the agent
			return a signature using
			the "rsa-sha2-256" or "rsa-sha2-512"
			signature methods respectively. These
			signature schemes are defined in
			<xref target="RFC8332" />.
		</t>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section><name>Locking and unlocking an agent</name>
		<t>
		The agent protocol supports requesting that an agent
		temporarily lock itself with a pass-phrase. When locked, an
		agent MUST suspend processing of sensitive operations
		(private key signature operations at the very least) until it
		has been unlocked with the same pass-phrase.
		</t>
		<t>
		The following message requests agent locking
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_LOCK
    string           passphrase
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		The agent shall reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS if locked
		successfully or SSH_AGENT_FAILURE otherwise (e.g. if the agent
		was already locked).
		</t>
		<t>
		The following message requests unlocking an agent:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_UNLOCK
    string           passphrase
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		If the agent is already locked and the pass-phrase matches the
		one used to lock it then it MUST unlock and reply with
		SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS. If the agent is already unlocked or if the
		the pass-phrase does not match it MUST reply with
		SSH_AGENT_FAILURE. An agent SHOULD take countermeasures
		against brute-force guessing attacks against the pass-phrase.
		</t>
	</section>
	<section><name>Extension mechanism</name>
		<t>
		The agent protocol includes an optional extension mechanism
		that allows vendor-specific and experimental messages to be
		sent via the agent protocol. Extension requests from the
		client consist of:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_AGENTC_EXTENSION
    string           extension type
    byte[]           extension request-specific contents
		</sourcecode>

<section anchor="connecting"><name>Connecting to an agent</name>
	<t>
	Agents are exposed to the local system using a connection-oriented
	endpoint. On Unix-like systems, it is typical to arrange for
	the agent to listen on a filesystem-based Unix domain socket.
	On Microsoft Windows, it is usual to use a Windows Named Pipe.
	Access to these endpoints should be controlled as discussed in
	<xref target="Security" />.
	</t>
	<t>
	In both cases, it is common to expose the name or address of the
	listening endpoint via an environment variable named "SSH_AUTH_SOCK".
	Clients of an agent will use this variable to locate and connect to
	the listening agent. Agents alternately MAY use an implicit mechanism
	for clients to locate their endpoint, such as a default per-user
	location.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="fwd"><name>Forwarding access to an agent</name>
	<t>
	The agent protocol may be forwarded over a SSH connection, using the
	<xref target="RFC4254" /> connection protocol, allowing agent
	forwarding to be requested for any session channel, using a model
	that is similar to the connection protocol's support for X11 Forwarding
	(<xref target="RFC4254" section="6.3"/>).
	This feature is OPTIONAL for SSH protocol and agent implementations.
	</t>
	<t>
	Note that the deployed integration with the SSH protocol uses
	vendor-specific names.
	</t>
	<section anchor="fwdext" title="Advertising agent forwarding support">
		<t>
		Support for agent forwarding may be advertised by a SSH
		protocol server using the <xref target="RFC8308" /> extension
		mechanism using the name "agent-forward" in the
		SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO message.
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    string           "agent-forward"
    string           "0" (version)
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		Note that this protocol substantially predates the existence
		of the <xref target="RFC8308" /> extension mechanism and
		several widely-deployed SSH implementations that support agent
		forwarding do not advertise their ability to do so. Clients
		MAY opportunistically attempt to request agent forwarding in
		the absence of an <xref target="RFC8308" /> advertisement
		using the vendor-specific names mentioned below.
		Likewise, servers MAY implement the vendor-specific names in
		addition to the one described here.
		</t>
	</section>
	<section anchor="fwdreq"><name>Requesting agent forwarding</name>
		<t>
		A client may request agent forwarding for a previously-opened
		session (<xref target="RFC4254" section="6.1" />) using the
		following channel request. This request is sent after the
		channel has been opened, but before a shell, command or
		subsystem has been executed.
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST
    uint32           channel_id
    string           "agent-req" or "auth-agent-req@openssh.com"
    boolean          want_reply
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		Where channel_id is the identifier for an established session
		channel (as returned from a previous SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN
		request, and the want_reply flag indicates whether the server
		should respond with a confirmation of whether the request was
		successful (as specified in
		<xref target="RFC4254" section="5.4"/>)
		</t>
		<t>
		If a SSH server accepts this request, typically it will arrange
		to make a endpoint (e.g. a listening socket) available and
		advertise this fact to the subordinate session. Most
		implementations on Unix-like systems do this by providing a
		user-private listening Unix domain socket and recording its
		location in an environment variable $SSH_AUTH_SOCK.
		</t>
		<t>
		As mentioned previously, many deployed implementations only
		support the former, pre-standardisation
		"auth-agent-req@openssh.com" request name. The latter
		"agent-req" name SHOULD only be used if support was explicitly
		advertised as per <xref target="fwdext" />.
		</t>
	</section>
	<section anchor="fwdtype"><name>Agent connection requests</name>
		<t>
		After a client has requested that a session have agent
		forwarding enabled, the server later may request a
		connection to the forwarded agent. The server does this by
		requesting a dedicated channel to communicate with the
		client's agent.
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
    byte             SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN
    string           "agent-connect" or "auth-agent@openssh.com"
    uint32           channel_id
    uint32           local_window
    uint32           local_maxpacket
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		The channel_id, local_window and local_maxpacket fields
		should be interpreted as specified by
		<xref target="RFC4254" section="5.1"/>.
		</t>
		<t>
		As above, the latter "agent-connect" open type name SHOULD
		only be used if support was explicitly advertised as per
		<xref target="fwdext" />.
		</t>
		<t>
		A client SHOULD be prepared to handle multiple concurrent
		active agent connections.
		A client MAY accept agent connection requests (subject to
		authorisation) without a prior agent forwarding request having
		been made to support the situation where agent forwarding
		without opening a session is desired.
		Similarly, a client MAY continue to accept agent connection
		requests after the session for which agent forwarding was
		requested has closed.
		</t>
		<t>
		A client MUST refuse unauthorised agent connection requests,
		i.e. when agent forwarding was not desired or requested but
		a server sends an agent connection request anyway.
		</t>
		<t>
		Note the connection request provides no way to identify which
		session channel a given agent connection request relates to.
		This implies that a SSH connection can functionally forward
		access to only a single client-side agent concurrently using
		this protocol.

<section anchor="Security"><name>Security Considerations</name>
	<t>
	The agent is a service that is tasked with retaining and providing
	controlled access to what are typically long-lived login
	authentication credentials. It is by nature a sensitive and trusted
	software component. Moreover, the agent protocol itself does not
	include any authentication or transport security; ability to
	communicate with an agent is usually sufficient to invoke it to
	perform private key operations.
	</t>
	<t>
	Since being able to access an agent is usually sufficient to perform
	private key operations, it is critically important that the agent
	only be exposed to its owner and their authorised delegates.
	</t>
	<t>
	The primary design intention of an agent is that an attacker with
	unprivileged access to their victim's agent should be prevented from
	gaining a copy of any keys that have been loaded into it. This may
	not preclude the attacker from stealing use of those keys (e.g.
	if they have been loaded without a confirmation constraint).
	</t>
	<t>
	Given this, the agent should, as far as possible, prevent its
	memory being read by other processes to direct theft of loaded keys.
	This typically include disabling debugging interfaces and
	preventing process memory dumps on abnormal termination.
	</t>
	<t>
	Another, more subtle, means by which keys may be stolen are via
	cryptographic side-channels. Private key operations may leak
	information about the contents of keys via differences in timing,
	power use or by side-effects in the memory subsystems (e.g. CPU
	caches) of the host running the agent. For the case of a local
	attacker and an agent holding unconstrained keys, the only limit
	on the number of private key operations the attacker may be able
	to observe is the rate at which the CPU can perform signatures.
	This grants the attacker an almost ideal oracle for side-channel
	attacks.  While a full treatment of side-channel attacks is beyond
	the scope of this specification, agents SHOULD use cryptographic
	implementations that are resistant to side-channel attacks and MAY
	take additional measures to hide the actual time spent processing
	private key operations.
	</t>
	<t>
	Forwarding access to a local agent over a SSH connection
	(<xref target="fwd" />) inherently creates a transitive trust
	relationship. SSH implementations SHOULD NOT forward use of an agent
	by default and MAY implement additional controls over key visibility
	and use for forwarded agent connections.
	</t>
	<t>
	Implementation of smartcard keys requires some care too. On some systems
	smartcards are invoked via shared libraries that must be loaded
	to make use of keys hosted on the device (a path to a PKCS#11 module,
	for example). Loading a shared libraries on most platforms implies
	automatic execution of code in that library in the address space of
	the process that loads it. Agents that support loading smartcard keys
	via library path SHOULD ensure that only trusted smartcard provider
	libraries are loadable, SHOULD ensure that loaded smartcard library code
	cannot gain access to other keys loaded in the agent and MAY disallow
	remote clients from loading smartcard keys entirely.
	</t>
</section>
<section anchor="implstatus"><name>Implementation Status</name>
	<t>
	This section records the status of known implementations of the
	protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
	this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
	<xref target="RFC7942" />. The description of implementations in
	this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes
	in progressing drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any
	individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
	IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
	information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
	This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a
	catalog of available implementations or their features. Readers
	are advised to note that other implementations may exist.
	</t>
	<t>
	According to <xref target="RFC7942" />, "this will allow reviewers
	and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that
	have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of
	valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented
	protocols more mature. It is up to the individual working groups
	to use this information as they see fit".

				<t>
				This document describes the Secure Shell
				authentication agent protocol (i.e., the
				protocol used between a client requesting
				authentication and the authentication agent).
				This protocol usually runs in a
				machine-spe-cific local channel or over a
				forwarded authentication channel. It is
				assumed that the channel is trusted, so no
				protection for the communications channel
				is provided by this protocol.
