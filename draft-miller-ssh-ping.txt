1.  Introduction

   Secure Shell (SSH) is a suite of protocols that are used for secure
   remote connections, login and file transfer across untrusted
   networks.  At the core of this protocol suite is the SSH Transport
   Layer Protocol [RFC4253] which defines an encrypted, message-based
   tranport that the other protocols build upon.

   SSH Transport Layer Protocol defines encryption, authentication, key
   agreement, a packet format and a number of message types to be used
   by the transport layer itself.  This document extends the transport
   layer protocol with a new pair of messages that implement a ping-like
   facility that may be used for testing, protocol-level measurement and
   to mitigate traffic analysis.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Protocol Overview

   This document defines a transport-layer ping mechanism and specifies
   how support for these messages may be advertised using the [RFC8308]
   extension negotiation protocol.

Internet-Draft    SSH Transport Protocol Ping Facility        April 2023


   The ping facility is build around two new transport-layer messages
   SSH_MSG_PING and SSH_MSG_PONG, representing the request and response
   respectively.

3.  Motivation

   The SSH suite of protocols currently offers no way to perform a ping
   operation, specifically sending a sequence of bytes to a peer and
   having the peer return the same exact byte sequence.  This operation
   is useful for gathering transport latency metrics, validating end-to-
   end operation of the transport protocol during testing and as a
   primitive to mitigate traffic analysis.

   Several close analogues exist. the transport-layer SSH_MSG_IGNORE
   provides the ability to send data to the peer, but that data is
   simply dropped and not echoed back.

   The higher-level SSH Connection Protocol [RFC4253] defines channel
   and global requests that may require replies from the peer, and an
   extension mechanism that allows their arbitrary use without requiring
   the specification of new protocol numbers.  However, all of these
   requests require textual request names, which removes the possibility
   of sending minimally-sized ping requests.

   For example, the shortest possible SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST body (using
   an unintuitive one-character message name) is 10 bytes, whereas the
   smallest possible SSH_MSG_PING body is only four bytes.

   This may seem like a trivial difference, but the extra bytes required
   by the SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST means that the minimally-sized message
   would be larger than the smallest possible SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_DATA
   packet body of eight bytes, potentially making it discernable from
   keystroke data if used as a countermeasure for traffic analysis.

4.  Messages

   A transport-layer ping may be requested using the following message:

      byte        SSH_MSG_PING
      string      data

   Upon receiving this message, an implementation MAY reply with a
   SSH_MSG_PONG that exactly copies the data from the SSH_MSG_PING
   request.

      byte        SSH_MSG_PONG
      string      data

   Implementations that support this feature MUST NOT make any reply to
   a SSH_MSG_PONG message.

   A peer MAY elect not to reply to a ping request and MAY implement a
   limit of the size of data that it is prepared to return.
   Implementations MUST either return an exact copy of the entire data
   from the ping request or make no reply at all.

   SSH_MSG_PING requests MUST be replied to in the order that they were
   received.  If received during key exchange, the implementation MUST
   either delay its reply until after key exchange has concluded or
   simply not reply.  If an implementation holds replies to SSH_MSG_PING
   messages received during key exchange, then it SHOULD limit the
   number of queued replies to avoid resource exhaustion.

   Implementations SHOULD NOT issue SSH_MSG_PING requests nor make
   SSH_MSG_PONG replies before the authentication phase of the protocol
   has completed.

5.  Compatibility

   Because this defines new transport-layer messages and because
   [RFC4253] requires that implementations that do not support a given
   message type must return SSH_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED.  The use of
   SSH_MSG_PING SHOULD NOT be used unless the peer has negotiated
   support for it using the [RFC8308] Extension Negotiation mechanism.

   Support for this protocol feature may be advertised using the
   extension name "ping" in the [RFC8308] SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO extension
   advertisment message.

      string      "ping"
      string      "0" (version number)
