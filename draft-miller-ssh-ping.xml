      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
	Secure Shell (SSH) is a suite of protocols that are used for secure
	remote connections, login and file transfer across untrusted networks.
	At the core of this protocol suite is the SSH Transport Layer Protocol
	<xref target="RFC4253" /> which defines an encrypted, message-based
	tranport that the other protocols build upon.
      </t>
      <t>
	SSH Transport Layer Protocol defines encryption, authentication, key
	agreement, a packet format and a number of message types to be used
	by the transport layer itself. This document extends the transport
	layer protocol with a new pair of messages that implement a ping-like
	facility that may be used for testing, protocol-level measurement
	and to mitigate traffic analysis.

    <section>
      <name>Protocol Overview</name>
      <t>
	This document defines a transport-layer ping mechanism 
	and specifies how support for these messages may be advertised
	using the <xref target="RFC8308" /> extension negotiation protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
	The ping facility is build around two new transport-layer messages
	SSH_MSG_PING and SSH_MSG_PONG, representing the request and response
	respectively.
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <name>Motivation</name>
      <t>
	The SSH suite of protocols currently offers no way to perform a ping
	operation, specifically sending a sequence of bytes to a peer
	and having the peer return the same exact byte sequence. This
	operation is useful for gathering transport latency metrics,
	validating end-to-end operation of the transport protocol during
	testing and as a primitive to mitigate traffic analysis.
      </t>
      <t>
	Several close analogues exist. the transport-layer SSH_MSG_IGNORE
	provides the ability to send data to the peer, but that data is simply
	dropped and not echoed back.
      </t>
      <t>
	The higher-level SSH Connection Protocol 
	<xref target="RFC4253" /> defines channel and global requests that
	may require replies from the peer, and an extension mechanism that
	allows their arbitrary use without requiring the specification of new
	protocol numbers. However, all of these requests require textual
	request names, which removes the possibility of sending minimally-sized
	ping requests.
      </t>
      <t>
	For example, the shortest possible SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST
	body (using an unintuitive one-character message name) is 10 bytes,
	whereas the smallest possible SSH_MSG_PING body is only four bytes.
      </t>
      <t>
	This may seem like a trivial difference, but the extra bytes required by
	the SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST means that the minimally-sized message would
	be larger than the smallest possible SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_DATA packet body
	of eight bytes, potentially making it discernable from keystroke data
	if used as a countermeasure for traffic analysis.
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <name>Messages</name>
      <t>
	A transport-layer ping may be requested using the following message:
      </t>
      <sourcecode markers="false">
      <![CDATA[
   byte        SSH_MSG_PING
   string      data
        ]]>
        </sourcecode>
      <t>
	Upon receiving this message, an implementation MAY reply with a
	SSH_MSG_PONG that exactly copies the data from the SSH_MSG_PING request.
      </t>
      <sourcecode markers="false">
      <![CDATA[
   byte        SSH_MSG_PONG
   string      data
      ]]>
      </sourcecode>
      <t>
	Implementations that support this feature MUST NOT make any reply to
	a SSH_MSG_PONG message.
      </t>
      <t>
	A peer MAY elect not to reply to a ping request and MAY implement
	a limit of the size of data that it is prepared to return.
	Implementations MUST either return an exact copy of the entire data
	from the ping request or make no reply at all.
      </t>
      <t>
	SSH_MSG_PING requests MUST be replied to in the order that they were
	received. If received during key exchange, the implementation MUST
	either delay its reply until after key exchange has concluded or simply
	not reply.
	If an implementation holds replies to SSH_MSG_PING messages received
	during key exchange, then it SHOULD limit the number of queued replies
	to avoid resource exhaustion.
      </t>
      <t>
	Implementations SHOULD NOT issue SSH_MSG_PING requests nor make
	SSH_MSG_PONG replies before the authentication phase of the protocol
	has completed.
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="compat">
      <name>Compatibility</name>
      <t>
	Because this defines new transport-layer messages and because
	<xref target="RFC4253" /> requires that implementations that do not
	support a given message type must return SSH_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED. The
	use of SSH_MSG_PING SHOULD NOT be used unless the peer has negotiated
	support for it using the <xref target="RFC8308" /> Extension
	Negotiation mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
	Support for this protocol feature may be advertised using the extension
	name "ping" in the <xref target="RFC8308" /> SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO extension
	advertisment message.
      </t>
      <sourcecode markers="false">
      <![CDATA[
   string      "ping"
   string      "0" (version number)
      ]]>
