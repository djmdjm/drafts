Abstract

   This document describes an extension to allow a Secure Shell (SSH)
   server to inform a client of the full set of host keys it supports.
   This may be used for graceful host key rotation and to provide keys
   for additional signature algorithms to the client, supporting
   algorithm agility.

1.  Introduction

   Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic protocol for secure remote
   connections and login over untrusted networks.  The SSH transport
   layer [RFC4253] includes server authentication though a public key
   signature.  The signature algorithm used for this authentication is
   negotiated between the client and server at the start of the key
   agreement subprotocol, and the final message sent by the server at
   the completion of key agreement typically contains a signature made
   using the negotiated algorithm.

Internet-Draft      Host key update mechanism for SSH        August 2025


   Excluding certified keys such as "pgp-sign-rsa" (Section 6.6 of
   [RFC4253]) or OpenSSH certificates ([I-D.miller-ssh-cert]), the SSH
   protocol does not specify any way for a client to learn the host keys
   of a server.  Public keys may be shared out-of-band but are more
   commonly learned for a given server the first time a client connects
   to it and trusted thereafter.  This is the origin of the Trust on
   First Use (TOFU) pattern.

   There is no facility in the SSH transport protocol that allows a
   server to gracefully rotate its host keys.  Unless coordinated out-
   of-band, a server changing host keys in this model is a hard break of
   connection trust, as any client that had learned the previous host
   key would now be met with an unexpected and untrusted key attempting
   to authenticate the final key exchange.  This situation is
   effectively indistinguishable from an on-path adversary hijacking the
   connection.

   Similarly, the SSH transport protocol offers no way for a server to
   inform the client of keys for alternate signature algorithms that it
   supports; if learning keys in-band, the client must learn the key for
   each signature algorithm separately, and there is no way to use a
   previously-learned key to bootstrap trust for another.

   This document describes a simple extension to the SSH protocol that
   provides a mechanism for a server to advertise its full set of host
   keys to a client, and to prove possession of the requisite private
   key material for each of them.

   This extension takes the form of a pair of global requests (Section 4
   of [RFC4254]): "hostkeys", sent by a server to advertise its set of
   keys and "hostkeys-prove", which may be sent by a client to request a
   server prove possession of the private keys corresponding to one or
   more of these keys.

   Although this extension addresses a missing feature of the SSH
   transport protocol ([RFC4253]), it is implemented using a message
   defined for the SSH connection protocol ([RFC4254]), a notionally
   higher protocol layer.  The reason for this is that the transport
   protocol lacks a defined extension message type and because some SSH
   protocol implementation will terminate the connection when a
   transport message of unsupported type is received, whereas connection
   protocol global requests are explicitly specified to gracefully fail
   when an endpoint does not support them.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Protocol

   As mentioned above, this extension consists of a pair of global
   requests: "hostkeys" and "hostkeys-prove".  These are both messages
   of type SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST (Section 4 of [RFC4254]).

   These messages may only be sent after the SSH authentication
   subprotocol ([RFC4252]) has has completed, as signalled by the server
   sending SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS.  They MUST NOT be sent prior to the
   completion of user authentication.

   Messages described here use the standard SSH protocol wire encoding
   types defined in Section 5 of [RFC4251].

2.1.  hostkeys advertisment

   This message is sent by a server to inform a client of the public
   keys it supports.  It is typically sent immediately after user
   authentication succeeds, but MAY be sent at any time later.  It MUST
   NOT be sent more than once by a server over the course of a given SSH
   transport connection.

       byte             SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST
       string           "hostkeys" or "hostkeys-00@openssh.com"
       char             0 /* do not want reply */
       string[]         hostkeys

   Where "hostkeys" consists of one or more public key blobs encoded as
   described in Section 2.3.  Identical host keys MUST NOT be repeated
   in this message, i.e.  every host key in the set must be unique.

   When a client receives this message, it MAY compare the set of host
   keys contained therein with the host keys it had recorded for the
   server.  In cases where the client had previously recorded a host key
   but that key is no longer in the advertised set, it MAY delete or
   disable the key locally.  In cases where the server advertised new,
   additional host keys that the client had not previously recorded, the
   client SHOULD request the server prove possession of the
   corresponding private key using the following request.

Internet-Draft      Host key update mechanism for SSH        August 2025


2.2.  hostkeys-prove request

   This message is sent by a client to request a server prove possession
   of the private key material corresponding to one or more public keys.
   It is typically sent after a client has received a "hostkeys"
   advertisement to request private key possession proofs only for keys
   it has not seen before.

       byte             SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST
       string           "hostkeys-prove"
       char             1 /* do want reply */
       string[]         hostkeys

   Where "hostkeys" consists of one or more public key blobs encoded as
   described in Section 2.3.  All hostkeys in this request MUST BE
   unique; no key may be repeated.

   A server MUST reply to this request either with the success message
   defined below or a SSH_MSG_REQUEST_FAILURE if the server (in case of
   failure or unwillness to service the request).  If a client receives
   such a failure, it MUST NOT trust any new keys provided in the
   initial "hostkeys" message.

   On success, the server returns the following message:

       byte             SSH_MSG_REQUEST_SUCCESS
       string[]         signatures

   Where "signatures" consists signatures made by the requested
   "hostkeys".  The number of signatures present MUST be identical to
   the number of host keys requested and they MUST appear in identical
   order to their counterpart host keys.

   Each signature is made by signing the following structure with the
   corresponding key and using the signature algorithm and encoding as
   it is specified for SSH (e.g.  Section 3.1.1 of [RFC5656] for "ecdsa-
   sha2-* keys).  Note that RSA host keys, which unlike other key types
   used in SSH can support multiple signature algorithms, have
   additional rules described below in Section 2.2.1.

       string           "hostkeys-prove-0"
       string           session identifier
       string           hostkey

   Where the "hostkey" is the host key in question, also encoded as
   described in Section 2.3, and "session identifier" is the session
   identifier derived during the initial SSH transport key exchange as
   described in Section 7.2 of [RFC4253].

   When a client receives a proof for new host keys, it MUST verify the
   signature for each, after which it MAY record the new host key as
   valid for the server.

2.2.1.  Special handling for RSA host keys

   Most key types used in SSH support only a single signature algorithm,
   but RSA keys are an exception in that they can generate signatures
   that use SHA-1, SHA-256 or SHA-512 as the signature hash.  Which
   variant is used for host key signatures is negotiated at the start of
   key agreement via the algorithm names "ssh-rsa" (RSA-SHA1), "rsa-
   sha2-256" or "rsa-sha2-512".

   If a RSA signature algorithm was selected during initial key
   agreement, then the same algorithm MUST be used for signing hostkey
   proofs for any RSA keys the server supports.  An exception to this is
   if "ssh-rsa" (i.e. the insecure RSA-SHA1 mode) was negotiated, in
   which case the "hostkeys-prove" request MUST fail and the server
   shall return a SSH_MSG_REQUEST_FAILURE.

   To avoid this situation, a server MAY skip advertising hostkeys when
   "ssh-rsa" is the negotiated host key signature algorithm.
   Alternately a server MAY exclude RSA host keys from the "hostkeys"
   advertisment message if other host key types are available.

   If a non-RSA host key signature algorithm was selected during initial
   key agreement, then either of the "rsa-sha2-256" or "rsa-sha2-512"
   signature algorithms may be used to sign a proof for a RSA host key.

2.2.2.  Legacy vendor-specific hostkey proof request

   Existing implementations support the hostkey proof extension under a
   vendor-specific name, which appears in both the request name and in
   the signed data.  To retain compatibility, implementations MAY
   support the vendor names in addition to the assigned names in this
   document.  A hostkey proof request using the vendor-specific name
   will be:

       byte             SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST
       string           "hostkeys-prove-00@openssh.com"
       char             1 /* do want reply */
       string[]         hostkeys

   When accepting a hostkey proof request that uses the vendor-specifc
   name, clients and server MUST generate and verify signatures over a
   structure that also uses the vendor-specific name:

Internet-Draft      Host key update mechanism for SSH        August 2025


       string           "hostkeys-prove-00@openssh.com"
       string           session identifier
       string           hostkey

2.3.  Public key encoding

   In this extension, keys are encoded as strings using the the standard
   SSH wire encoding for public keys.  SSH protocol key encodings are
   defined in [RFC4253] for "ssh-rsa" and "ssh-dss" keys, in [RFC5656]
   for "ecdsa-sha2-*" keys and in [RFC8709] for "ssh-ed25519" and "ssh-
   ed448" keys.

2.4.  Advertising support for this extension

   Support for this extension may be advertised by a SSH protocol server
   using the [RFC8308] extension mechanism using the name "hostkeys" in
   the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO message.

       string           "hostkeys"
       string           "0" (version)

   Note that this extension predates the existence of the [RFC8308]
   extension mechanism and several widely-deployed SSH implementations
   that support it do not advertise their ability to do so.

   As global request messages are required by [RFC4254] to be gracefully
   ignored by an endpoint that does not support them, implementations
   MAY opportunistically use this extension via the vendor-specific
   names in the absence of an [RFC8308] advertisement using the vendor-
   specific names mentioned above.

   Likewise, clients and server MAY implement the vendor-specific names
   in addition to the ones described here (though note the special
   handling required for proof messages in Section 2.2.2).  However, if
   a an endpoint advertises support for this extension via the EXT_INFO
   mechanism, the peer SHOULD use the standard global request names to
   invoke it instead of the vendor-specific names.

3.  Motivations

   There are two motivating applications for this extension: graceful
   host key rotation and signature algorithm agility.

Internet-Draft      Host key update mechanism for SSH        August 2025


3.1.  Host key rotation

   With a degree of planning and coordination, this extension may be
   used to gracefully rotate a server's host keys.  To do this, a server
   begins by advertising via this extension one or more host keys in
   addition to the ones that it currently offers by default.  As clients
   that support this extension connect to the server, these host keys
   will be learned and recorded as valid keys for the server.  After
   some grace interval, or when all identified clients are known to have
   connected at least once, the original host keys may be removed from
   the server and clients will now use the new keys by default without a
   discontinuity of trust.

3.2.  Algorithm agility

   This case is similar to host key rotation, except to note that it is
   possible to advertise host keys of entirely different signature
   algorithms.  By following a process similar to the above host key
   rotation scheme, and assuming the SSH clients support them, it is
   possible to retire weak or poorly-performing signature algorithms in
   favour of better ones.  In the near future, it is likely this
   mechanism will be useful to assist the deployment of Post-Quantum
   signature schemes without trust discontinuities.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This extension requires two existing registries to be modified.

4.1.  Additions to SSH Connection Protocol Global Request Names

   IANA is requested to insert the following entries into the table
   Connection Protocol Global Request Names [IANA-SSH-GLOBALREQS] under
   Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Parameters [RFC4250].

5.  Security Considerations

   This extension defines a mechanism for cryptographic key management,
   which always needs careful handling.  This section calls attention to
   some specific areas of concern.

5.1.  Trusting keys

   This mechanism cannot be used to estabish trust in a SSH server where
   it no key was previously trusted.  Specifically, if a client learned
   a host key from an on-path adversary rather than the intended
   destination host, then this extension cannot improve this situation.
   Keys learned though this mechanism can never be more trustworthy than
   the key used to establish the SSH transport session.

5.2.  Dangers of ignoring proof of private key possession

   This host key update mechanism operates using two messages: an
   advertisement of host keys and a proof of private key possession.
   SSH implementations that implement this extension MUST implement
   support for both messages and MUST NOT record new host keys without
   verifying private key possession proofs.

   Supporting the advertisment component alone, or recording host keys
   without checking their private key possession proofs allows an attack
   where a malicious server advertises a host key for a different
   legitimate server.  If that host key is recorded and subsequently
   used by a client when connecting to the malicious server, then the
   malicious server could forward the connection to the legitimate
   server.  This may result in actions intended to be performed on the
   malicious server being instead performed on the legitimate one.

Internet-Draft      Host key update mechanism for SSH        August 2025


5.3.  Denial of service

   This extension may require servers perform additional cryptographic
   signature operations, and require clients to perform additional
   verification operations.  Implementation should enforce some limit on
   the maximum number of keys they will accept for both the "hostkeys"
   and "hostkeys-prove" messages.

5.4.  Weak signature algorithms

   Implementations that retain support for the weak "ssh-rsa" (RSA-SHA1)
   signature algorithm must pay careful attention to the considerations
   in Section 2.2.1.  Similar special handling may be required in future
   if other signature algorithms are found to be weak.

5.5.  Timing attack considerations

   This mechanism provides a way for a SSH client to request additional
   signatures using the host private keys.  In doing so, it magnifies
   the attack surface for observing timing discrepancies in the
   signature operation.  Although a malicious client has little control
   over the signed data, implementations should be aware of this
   situation and ensure that "hostkeys-prove" replies do not reveal
   information useful towards recovering the private key itself.

6.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
